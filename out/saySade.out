Binomial coefficients (a+b)^r = a^r + c1xa^(r-1)xb + c2xa^(r-2)xb^2 + ... + c(r-1)xaxb^(r-1) + crxb^r
r=0 => 1
r=1 => 1,1
r=2 => 1,2,1
r=3 => 1,3,3,1
r=4 => 1,4,6,4,1
r=5 => 1,5,10,10,5,1
r=6 => 1,6,15,20,15,6,1
r=7 => 1,7,21,35,35,21,7,1
r=8 => 1,8,28,56,70,56,28,8,1
r=9 => 1,9,36,84,126,126,84,36,9,1

There are 10 ways of choosing 2 objects out of 5 without repetition (when we don't care about their order)..
Here are all those: {01 02 03 04 12 13 14 23 24 34}
And, again, there are 10 of them. Count them all if you don't believe me!
