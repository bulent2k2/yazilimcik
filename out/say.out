Binomial coefficients (a+b)^r = a^r + c1xa^(r-1)xb + c2xa^(r-2)xb^2 + ... + c(r-1)xaxb^(r-1) + crxb^r
r=0 => 1
r=1 => 1,1
r=2 => 1,2,1
r=3 => 1,3,3,1
r=4 => 1,4,6,4,1
r=5 => 1,5,10,10,5,1
r=6 => 1,6,15,20,15,6,1
r=7 => 1,7,21,35,35,21,7,1
r=8 => 1,8,28,56,70,56,28,8,1
r=9 => 1,9,36,84,126,126,84,36,9,1

There are 35 ways of choosing 3 out of 5 objects with repetition (when we don't care about their order)..
Here are all those: {000 001 002 003 004 011 012 013 014 022 023 024 033 034 044 111 112 113 114 122 123 124 133 134 144 222 223 224 233 234 244 333 334 344 444}
And, again, there are 35 of them. Count them all if you don't believe me!
